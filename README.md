# Idk What to call the game(yet)

Welcome to **The Mystery Game**, where you dodge red squares like it's your job and hit the right squares to extend your game time! What’s the name of the game? Well, I haven't figured that out yet. Suggestions are welcomed!

## 🎮 How to Play

1. **Click the White Squares**: These are your friends. They give you points and help you extend your playtime.
2. **Avoid the Red Squares**: These are the bad guys. They will zap your score and shorten your time. They're basically the villains of this story.
3. **Complete the Progress Bar**: Fill it up to gain an extra 5 seconds of taps!

## 🕹️ Features

- **Puzzlingly Fun**: It's simple, addictive, and might just make you question your life choices.
- **Dynamic Difficulty**: The game is easy at first, but just wait until you meet the red squares. They don’t play nice!
- **High Score**: Beat your own record, or don’t. It’s up to you. The only person you’ll be disappointing is yourself.

## 💡 How to Set Up

1. **Clone the Repo**: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git`
2. **Navigate to the Directory**: `cd your-repo-name`
3. **Open the `index.html`**: Just double-click it, or open it in your favorite browser.
4. **Play the Game**: Try not to rage-quit.
